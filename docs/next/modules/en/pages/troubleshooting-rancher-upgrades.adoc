= Troubleshooting Rancher upgrades
:revdate: 2025-07-03
:page-revdate: {revdate}

[WARNING]
====
Upgrading to Rancher v2.7.2 will fail if {elemental-product-name} clusters are defined. The rancher pod gets stuck in a crash loop (see https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41145).
====

Note that the issue is present only if at least one {elemental-product-name} cluster is defined.

To workaround the issue create an empty `dynamicschemas.management.cattle.io` resource named `machineinventoryselectortemplate`:

[,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: DynamicSchema
apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
metadata:
  name: machineinventoryselectortemplate
EOF

----

The crash loop will stop and Rancher upgrade will complete successfully.
