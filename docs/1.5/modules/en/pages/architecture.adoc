{elemental-product-name} is the combination of two main projects: the link:{elemental_toolkit_url}[{elemental_toolkit_name}] and the link:{elemental_operator_url}[{elemental_operator_name}].

The link:{elemental_toolkit_url}[{elemental_toolkit_name}] enables OS installation and updates from OCI container images, so the OS can be distributed and retrieved via container registries.

The link:{elemental_operator_url}[{elemental_operator_name}] extends Rancher with OS provisioning and OS management functionalities, leveraging the {elemental-product-name} Toolkit.
It bridges the gap between the link:{elemental_toolkit_url}[{elemental_toolkit_name}] and the
https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher#launching-kubernetes-on-new-nodes-in-an-infrastructure-provider-1[Rancher RKE2/K3s Cluster provisioning],
to provide a seamless experience going from hosts without OS to fully configured Kubernetes Clusters.

This is achieved through a xref:architecture-services.adoc[set of services] offered by {elemental-product-name} that are made possible thanks to the xref:architecture-components.adoc[components] borrowed from the {elemental-product-name} Toolkit and the {elemental-product-name} Operator projects.
