= Release Notes

The {elemental-product-name} project stack is made of various components such as the `Operator` and `UI` for example.

Each of these components have an independent development lifecycle with its own versioning. Once a new version is ready, meaning it fully integrates with the others components of the {elemental-product-name} project stack, a release is made.

Here's the different components, their latest version and a link to the respective release notes on GitHub:
