== `upgradeContainer`

This allows to overwrite the default `upgrade` field of System Upgrade Controller plans (see xref:upgrade-lifecycle.adoc#_components[upgrade compontents]) based on this ManagedOSVersion.
These keys are translated by the System Upgrade Controller to a Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#Container[container] specification.
This is the container responsible of running an OS upgrade.
