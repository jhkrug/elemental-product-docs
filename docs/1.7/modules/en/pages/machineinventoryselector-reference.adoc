A MachineInventorySelector selects MachineInventories based on applied selectors (usually pattern matching on MachineInventory label values).

MachineInventorySelectors have two conditions:

* `InventoryReady`, turns to true if the MachineInventorySelector has found a matching MachineInventory and has successfully set itself as the MachineInventory owner.
* `Ready`, tracks if the selector already adopted a machine and started the kubernetes provisioning process (node bootstrap).
